# AutoCorrecter
To run the program, run AutocorrectDemo.java.

There is both a small and a large text file that the user can feed to the MergeSort algorithm, which gets sorted into the HashTable of LinkedLists. This text file will be the contain all the words that the algorithm will use to autocorrect the user's query/text in the text field.

General Rules:
 - If using small.txt, the user should limit the size of their HashTable to a relatively small number. I find 10 to be optimal.
 - If using nyt.txt, the user should use a much larger size for their HashTable. I find 100 to be optimal.
