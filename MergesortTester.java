/**
 * To write a Comparator, all you have to do is implement the "compare" function, which is exactly
 * like the "compareTo" function that is built into Java classes that implement the "Comparable" interface.
 * The reason Comparators exist is so you can write a class that can have a default way of comparing its objects
 * (implement Comparable and write a compareTo method), but then you can have secondary ways of comparing objects
 * by writing a separate Comparator class.  For instance, the String object's default compareTo() method takes
 * uppercase/lowercase into account.  If you want a case-insensitive comparison, you must use a separate Comparator.
